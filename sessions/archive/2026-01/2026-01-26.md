# Session Log: 2026-01-26

## Session: 11:22

### Topics
- Initial MARVIN setup and onboarding
- Created personal workspace at `/Users/matthewdruhl/marvin`

- Defined goals and priorities

### Decisions
- Communication style: Mix of casual and professional
- Workspace location: `/Users/matthewdruhl/marvin`
- Template location: `/Users/matthewdruhl/marvin-template`
- IDE: VS Code
- Integrations: Google Calendar and Gmail

### Goals Established
**Work Goals:**
- Master Data Structures and Algorithms
- Develop Data Engineering skills (Python, SQL, NoSQL, Linux, Shell Scripting, ETL/Data Pipelines, Data Warehouse Fundamentals)
- Land a new job

**Personal Goals:**
- Exercise regularly
- Work on DND coding project at `/Users/matthewdruhl/Code/AI/DnDProject`

### Open Threads
- Need to restart Claude Code to activate Google Workspace MCP tools
- Gmail inbox analysis pending (will do after restart)

### Next Actions
- Restart Claude Code to enable Gmail integration
- Analyze Gmail inbox
- Begin working on skill development priorities

## Session: 12:30

### Topics
- Configured Google OAuth credentials to enable Gmail access
- Added user as test user to resolve OAuth verification error
- Successfully analyzed Gmail inbox (50+ unread messages)
- Identified job application responses across inbox and Updates folder

### Decisions
- Decided to skip promotional email cleanup/unsubscribe task
- Focused on identifying job application responses instead

### Job Application Status Identified
**Recent Updates (need follow-up):**
- Bestow - Backend Software Engineer II (Python)
- Alteryx - Application Update
- Canonical - Senior Software Engineer (Python/MongoDB) - update received
- Canonical - Software Engineer (Python/K8s) - update received

**Confirmations:**
- Quilt LLC, Epsilon, Best Egg, Canonical - applications submitted

### Inbox Breakdown
- 60% job alerts (LinkedIn, Indeed, EarnBetter)
- 25% financial/security alerts (USAA, GreenState)
- 10% learning content (DZone, Analytics Vidhya, Real Python)
- 5% military/education, promotions

### Open Threads
- Job application updates from Bestow, Alteryx, and Canonical (2) need to be reviewed
- Full content of "update" emails not yet pulled
- Security notifications from USAA/GreenState should be verified

### Next Actions
- Review full content of job application update emails
- Follow up on any interview requests or next steps
- Verify security notifications are legitimate
- Consider archiving promotional content

## Session: 18:28

### Topics
- Built D&D Campaign MCP server from scratch
- Learned MCP protocol fundamentals and architecture
- Created character management tools (get_character, update_hp, add_xp)
- Created inventory management tools (get_inventory, add_item, remove_item)
- Implemented multi-character support with hybrid approach (optional character_name parameter)
- Added weapon-specific attributes (damage, properties, equipped)
- Debugged MCP connection issue (uv path problem)
- Successfully connected MCP to Claude.ai Desktop
- Explored options for mobile access

### Decisions
- Tech stack: Python + uv + MCP SDK
- Project location: `/Users/matthewdruhl/Code/AI/DnDProject/dnd-campaign-mcp`
- Data storage: Local JSON files (character-{name}.json, inventory-{name}.json, inventory-party.json)
- Multi-character system: Hybrid approach (Option 3) - active character concept + optional name parameter
- Character data format: Keep existing string format ("68 / 68") with parser functions
- Weapon attributes: name, quantity, type, description, equipped, damage, properties
- Properties parameter: Keep as array (works with Claude API, not Inspector UI)
- Mobile solution: Decided against cloud serverless (requires paid Claude API)

### What Was Built
**MCP Server (`/Users/matthewdruhl/Code/AI/DnDProject/dnd-campaign-mcp`):**
- Full project structure with uv package manager
- Helper functions for loading/saving characters and inventory
- Parse/format functions for "current / max" string format
- 6 MCP tools total (3 character + 3 inventory)
- Tested successfully with MCP Inspector
- Connected to Claude.ai Desktop app

**Data Files Created:**
- `data/current_character.txt` - Tracks active character (currently "max")
- `data/character-max.json` - Max's full character sheet (Level 7 Paladin)
- `data/inventory-max.json` - Max's personal inventory with weapons
- `data/inventory-party.json` - Shared party loot and pending splits

**Configuration:**
- Claude Desktop config at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Fixed path issue: Changed from `uv` to `/Users/matthewdruhl/.local/bin/uv`

### Learning Outcomes
- MCP protocol: stdio transport, tool definitions, inputSchema
- Async Python patterns (async/await)
- Tool design: optional parameters, hybrid approaches
- JSON data persistence patterns
- Debugging MCP servers via logs
- PATH resolution issues in sandboxed apps

### Open Threads
- Mobile access limitation (Claude.ai mobile app doesn't support MCP)
- Potential "eventual sync" pattern explored but not implemented:
  - Could log MCP calls on mobile, replay on desktop
  - Would require pending-changes.json and sync tools
  - Storage options: Project Knowledge, manual copy-paste, or cloud files
- Additional features not yet built:
  - Spell slot management tools
  - Campaign log/quest tracker
  - NPC database
  - Set active character tool
  - Long rest tool (restore resources)
  - Level up helper

### Next Actions
- Test MCP tools in actual Claude.ai Desktop conversation
- Run a quick D&D session to validate functionality
- Consider implementing "eventual sync" pattern for mobile access
- Add more character sheets for other PCs (Ella, Thor, etc.)
- Potentially expand with spell management, quest tracking, or campaign log tools
