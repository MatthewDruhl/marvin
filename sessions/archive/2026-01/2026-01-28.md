## Session: 18:05

### Topics
- Revoked exposed GitHub PAT token (security issue resolved)
- Sent follow-up email for job opportunity (12 days after initial contact)
- Studied Data Structures & Algorithms (Recursion, Linear/Binary Search, Bubble/Selection/Insertion Sort)
- Exercised (golf range)
- Built complete PostgreSQL database schema for D&D Character Sheet app
- Learned Docker Compose configuration from scratch
- Designed advanced database schema including Bag of Holding system
- Created environment configuration files (.env and .env.example)

### Decisions
- **Database Design:** Removed location tracking from vault and bank tables (simplified to general storage)
- **Bag of Holding System:** Implemented individual bag tracking (not pooled) for realistic gameplay
- **Bag Sizes:** Named sizes as small/medium/large/xlarge instead of Type I-IV (more intuitive)
- **Reference Data:** Created bag_types table with weight limits, volume limits, and market prices
- **Teaching Approach:** Senior developer → junior developer style with step-by-step explanations

### Database Schema Finalized (10 tables)
**Core:** characters, items
**Carried:** inventory, wealth
**Stored:** vault, bank
**Bags:** bag_types (reference), bags_of_holding, bag_contents, bag_wealth

**Key Features:**
- Individual bag tracking (multiple bags per character)
- Each bag can be in inventory or stored in vault
- Proper foreign keys with CASCADE delete
- Performance indexes on frequently queried columns
- Reference data pre-loaded for 4 bag sizes

### Open Threads
- Job application follow-up sent (awaiting response)
- PostgreSQL database complete and verified
- Environment files created (.env, .env.example)
- Need to create database.py for Python connection
- Need to write test script to verify database connection works
- Frontend and backend servers already running (Phase 1 complete)

### Next Actions
- Create database.py with SQLAlchemy connection using environment variables
- Write test script to verify Python can connect to PostgreSQL
- Test CRUD operations (create character, read, update, delete)
- Begin Phase 3: Build FastAPI endpoints for character management
- Continue DSA study (next: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Stack/Queue)
