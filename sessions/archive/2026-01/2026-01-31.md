# Session Log: 2026-01-31

## Session: 20:09

### Topics
- D&D Character Sheet Phase 3: Built schemas.py (Pydantic validation layer)
- Created 27 schemas across 10 models (Character, Item, Wealth, Bank, Inventory, Vault, BagOfHolding, BagContents, BagWealth)
- Learned schema patterns: Create, Update, Response types
- Learned schema inheritance to reduce duplication
- Learned composite key handling in schemas
- Learned when schemas are auto-created vs user-created
- Tested schemas.py successfully

### Decisions
- Use inheritance pattern (Base schemas) to reduce duplication for Character and Item
- Wealth/Bank don't need Create schemas (auto-created with character)
- BagWealth doesn't need Create schema (auto-created with bag)
- Update schemas have all fields optional (user only sends what changes)
- Response schemas include all database fields plus timestamps
- All Response schemas need `from_attributes = True` for ORM compatibility

### Code Written (by Matt)
- backend/app/schemas.py - Complete (27 Pydantic schemas, 229 lines)
- Schemas validated successfully with test import

### Open Threads
- Phase 3 remaining: routes/ directory and characters.py endpoint
- Matt will read Part 2 of guide tonight (Routes section, lines 226-488)
- Next session: Build characters.py with CRUD endpoints (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE)
- After characters.py: Build remaining route files (items.py, inventory.py, bags.py)
- After routes complete: Wire everything in main.py

### Next Actions
- Read Part 2 of Phase3-Remaining-Pieces.md guide (API Routes section)
- Create routes/ directory and __init__.py
- Build characters.py with full CRUD operations
- Test endpoints using /docs interactive API
