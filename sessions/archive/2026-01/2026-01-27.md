# Session Log: 2026-01-27

## Session: 11:34

### Topics
- Morning briefing and status check
- Discussed working in DND project folder via separate VS Code window

### Decisions
- None this session

### Open Threads
- Job application updates still need review (Bestow, Alteryx, Canonical x2)
- D&D MCP ready for live testing
- DSA and Data Engineering skill development not yet started

### Next Actions
- Review job application update emails
- Test D&D MCP in a live session
- Begin DSA practice

## Session: 21:44

### Topics
- Designed full-stack D&D Character Sheet application architecture
- Evaluated tech stack options (React + FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- Decided on project structure (monorepo vs separate repos)
- Set up project foundation with uv and Vite
- Configured .gitignore files for backend, frontend, and root
- Created development environment and verified both servers run

### Decisions
- **Tech Stack:** React (Vite) + FastAPI + PostgreSQL
- **Architecture:** REST API wrapper pattern (FastAPI between React and database)
- **Backend:** Python/FastAPI (you know Python well, FastAPI valuable for data engineering roles)
- **Frontend:** React with Vite (learning opportunity, job market value)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (runs locally, network-capable, easy cloud migration)
- **Project Structure:** Hybrid approach - MCP separate repo, web app (frontend+backend) in one repo
- **Ports:** MCP on 8000 (Claude.ai Desktop), new API on 8001, Postgres on 5432
- **Package Management:** Using `uv` with `pyproject.toml` (modern Python approach)
- **Testing:** pytest included as dev dependency throughout development

### Open Threads
- Need to create `.env.example` file for backend
- Need to create README.md with setup instructions
- PostgreSQL database setup with Docker (Phase 2)
- Database schema design for characters, items, inventory
- FastAPI endpoints implementation
- React frontend components
- MCP server migration to PostgreSQL
- **Security:** GitHub PAT exposed in Untitled-1 file - needs to be revoked

### Next Actions
- **URGENT:** Revoke exposed GitHub token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Create `.env.example` in backend folder
- Create comprehensive README.md
- Phase 2: Set up PostgreSQL with Docker (docker-compose.yml)
- Design database schema (characters, items, inventory tables)
- Build FastAPI endpoints with tests (TDD approach)
- Extract character/campaign data from Claude.ai session
