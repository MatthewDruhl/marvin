# Session Log: 2026-01-30

## Session: 13:55

### Topics
- Checked Gmail (20 unread messages from past 2 days)
- Reviewed job application updates: All 4 pending apps rejected (Bestow, Alteryx, Canonical x2)
- Added learning goals: FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Design & Docker Handbook
- Completed DSA: Merge Sort
- Exercise: 3 laps dog walk (~1.8 miles)
- Edited political commentary piece (grammar/structure)

### Decisions
- Marked USAA/GreenState security alerts as resolved
- Closed 4 job applications (rejections received)
- Added FreeCodeCamp courses to Data Engineering goals

### Open Threads
- VA Video Connect appointment Feb 6, 2026 @ 9:00 AM CST (7 days out)
- New job opportunities: Maven Clinic, GitHub (from LinkedIn)
- Appeared in 5 LinkedIn recruiter searches
- D&D Phase 3 ready to start (database.py + FastAPI endpoints)

### Next Actions
- Begin D&D Phase 3 in VS Code
- Continue DSA (Stack, Queue next)
- Consider FreeCodeCamp database design course

---

## Session: 17:30 (resumed)

### Topics
- Starting D&D Phase 3: Python database connection & FastAPI endpoints
- Full walkthrough teaching approach

### Permissions Granted
- D&D Character Sheet project: Full file access (Write/Edit) - no need to ask repeatedly
- Will notify if access revoked

### Communication Preferences
- No emojis or checkmarks - keep it professional
- Teaching style: Senior dev mentoring junior dev
- Make me run commands (uv sync, etc.) instead of doing it for me
- Guide with scaffolding/structure, I write the code

## Session: 17:30 - Phase 3 Build (Resumed)

### Topics
- Built config.py with Pydantic Settings (computed fields, ClassVar, type safety)
- Built database.py (engine, session factory, Base, dependency injection)
- Built models.py (10 SQLAlchemy ORM models)
- Learned debugging workflow (uv run, virtual environments)
- Created git branch: feature/phase3-backend-api
- Explored DND combat engine for potential code reuse
- Decided to keep projects separate for now (inventory vs combat mechanics)

### Key Learning
- Pydantic Settings for configuration management
- @computed_field and @property decorators
- SQLAlchemy engine and session patterns
- Dependency injection with yield
- Why sessions per request (isolation, transactions, cleanup)
- Database connection pooling vs sessions
- SQLAlchemy column mapping (String, Integer, Text, Boolean, TIMESTAMP)
- Primary keys: single, composite, auto-increment
- Foreign key relationships and ON DELETE CASCADE
- Lambda functions for dynamic timestamps
- Defaults in both database and ORM (defense in depth)
- Why singular class names with plural table names

### Code Written (by Matt)
- backend/app/config.py - Complete and tested
- backend/app/database.py - Complete and tested
- backend/app/models.py - Complete and tested (10 models)
- backend/init.sql - Updated (class → character_class)

### Models Completed
1. Character - Core entity with timestamps
2. Item - Item catalog
3. Inventory - Composite key (character + item)
4. Wealth - Single key + foreign key
5. Vault - Composite key with notes field
6. Bank - Single key + foreign key
7. BagType - Reference table
8. BagOfHolding - Auto-increment ID
9. BagContents - Composite key
10. BagWealth - Single key + foreign key

### Decisions
- Use computed DATABASE_URL from individual PostgreSQL settings (avoid redundancy)
- Use datetime.now(timezone.utc) for timezone-aware timestamps (modern Python 3.12+ best practice)
- Use lambdas for timestamp defaults (prevents stale values)
- Keep database defaults AND ORM defaults (defense in depth)
- Renamed SQL column from "class" to "character_class" (avoid Python keyword)
- Keep DND combat engine separate from web app database (different concerns)
- Rebuilding database is acceptable in development (no migrations yet)

### Communication Preferences Established
- No emojis or checkmarks in communication
- Teaching style: Senior dev mentoring junior dev
- Make Matt run commands (uv sync, etc.) instead of doing it for him
- Guide with scaffolding/structure, Matt writes the code
- Full file access granted for D&D project - no need to ask repeatedly

### Open Threads
- Phase 3 remaining: schemas.py, routes/, update main.py
- Educational guide created: ~/Documents/marvin/Phase3-Remaining-Pieces.md
- Database rebuilt with character_class column
- All 10 models tested and working with PostgreSQL

### Next Actions
- Read Phase3-Remaining-Pieces.md guide
- Build schemas.py (Pydantic models for API validation)
- Build routes/ directory (API endpoints for CRUD operations)
- Update main.py to wire everything together
- Test API with /docs interactive interface

## Session End: 19:15

**Summary:**
- Processed inbox, identified new job opportunities (Maven Clinic, GitHub)
- Closed 4 rejected applications, updated job search status
