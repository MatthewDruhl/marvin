# Session Log: 2026-01-29

## Session: 09:42

### Topics
- Created monitoring and management scripts for D&D project (monitor.sh, start-all.sh, stop-all.sh)
- Fixed VS Code workspace configuration (was showing backend as separate repo)
- Created .vscode configuration files (settings.json, extensions.json, launch.json)
- Studied DSA: Quick Sort algorithm
- Exercise: 15-minute dog walk

### Decisions
- **Script Organization:** All management scripts in project root with logs/ directory for output
- **VS Code Setup:** Configured as monorepo with proper Python interpreter path, formatters, and debug configurations
- **Startup Order:** PostgreSQL → MCP → Backend → Frontend (with health checks)

### Scripts Created
**monitor.sh:** Shows real-time CPU/memory usage for all services (Docker, MCP, Backend, Frontend)
**start-all.sh:** Starts all services in correct order with health checks and logging
**stop-all.sh:** Gracefully shuts down all services

**VS Code Configuration:**
- Python: Uses backend/.venv, Black formatter, pytest enabled
- File exclusions: Hides __pycache__, node_modules, .DS_Store
- Debug configs: FastAPI backend, current file, pytest tests
- Recommended extensions: Python, Prettier, Docker, SQLTools, GitLens

### Open Threads
- PostgreSQL and MCP server running, Frontend/Backend not yet started via new scripts
- Next DSA topics: Merge Sort, Stack, Queue
- Job applications still need review (4 pending updates)
- D&D Web App Phase 3: database.py and FastAPI endpoints not started yet

### Next Actions
- Continue DSA study (Merge Sort, Stack, Queue)
- Test new management scripts (start-all.sh, stop-all.sh)
- Begin Phase 3: Create database.py for Python/PostgreSQL connection
- Build FastAPI endpoints for character management
- Review job application updates
