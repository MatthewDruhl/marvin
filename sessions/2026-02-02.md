## Session: 13:07

### Topics
- TWC PDF form generation automation
- Created Python script to fill official TWC fillable PDF forms from CSV data
- Generated PDFs for all 4 completed weeks (Jan 11-17, Jan 18-24, Jan 25-31, Feb 1-7)
- Integrated PDF generation into `/update` and `/end` commands
- Renamed work search CSV files to 2-digit year format (26 instead of 2026)

### Decisions
- Use official TWC fillable PDF instead of creating from scratch (exact match guaranteed)
- Multi-page support: create part1, part2, etc. when more than 5 activities per week
- Automatic PDF generation on `/update` and `/end` commands
- CSV files renamed to work-search-week-26-MM-DD.csv format

### Files Created/Modified
- Created: `content/jobs/TWC/fill_twc_pdf.py` (PDF form filling script using PyPDF2)
- Created: `content/jobs/TWC/work-search-log-blank.pdf` (copy of original fillable form)
- Renamed: All CSV files from `work-search-week-2026-*` to `work-search-week-26-*`
- Updated: `.claude/commands/end.md` (added PDF generation step)
- Updated: `.claude/commands/update.md` (added PDF generation step)
- Generated PDFs:
  - `work-search-week-26-01-11-filled-part1.pdf` (activities 1-5)
  - `work-search-week-26-01-11-filled-part2.pdf` (activities 6-7)
  - `work-search-week-26-01-18-filled.pdf` (activities 1-4)
  - `work-search-week-26-01-25-filled.pdf` (activities 1-5)

### Technical Details
- Script maps CSV data to exact PDF form field names
- Handles checkboxes, text fields, dates, phone numbers (split format)
- Supports multi-page weeks (more than 5 activities)
- Handles empty rows and missing data gracefully
- Uses PyPDF2 library for PDF form manipulation

### Open Threads
