# Session Log: 2026-02-03

## Session: 09:38

### Topics
- MARVIN workspace file permissions - removed confirmation prompts for marvin folder operations
- Completed active todos (WorkInTexas docs, Peacock cancellation)
- AWS Recipe Book design review and enhancement
- Added AI recipe extraction feature using AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet vision)
- Created implementation guide for Claude Code with local-first development approach

### Decisions
- Updated MARVIN CLAUDE.md: Added "File Permissions" section for autonomous file operations in marvin workspace
- Updated todos.md: Marked WorkInTexas docs and Peacock cancellation as completed
- Added "Document everything" to MARVIN core principles (background agent outputs go in content/)
- Recipe book scope: 5 users (personal/family), essentially $0/month forever
- Tech stack: Python FastAPI + React + SQLite (local) → AWS serverless (deployment)
- AI extraction cost: ~$0.003 per image, ~$0.01/month for 5 users

### Files Created/Modified
- Updated: `CLAUDE.md` (added File Permissions section and "Document everything" principle)
- Updated: `state/todos.md` (moved 2 tasks to completed)
- Created: `content/aws-recipe-book-design.md` (comprehensive AWS serverless architecture, 1,616 lines)
- Updated: `content/aws-recipe-book-design.md` (added Bedrock vision AI feature, cost analysis, implementation details)
- Created: `content/recipe-book-implementation-guide.md` (step-by-step guide for Claude Code, local-first development)

### AWS Recipe Book Features
- **Core:** Recipe CRUD, image uploads, search, favorites, user auth
- **AI Feature:** Extract recipe from photo (cookbook page, recipe card, screenshot)
- **Cost (5 users):** $0 forever (free tier), AI extraction: $0.003/image
- **Tech:** FastAPI (Python) + React + SQLite locally, migrates to AWS Lambda + DynamoDB + S3
- **Implementation:** Complete backend code, schemas, routes, Bedrock integration provided

### Implementation Guide Contents
- Complete project structure (backend/frontend folders)
- Backend: Python 3.12 + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + uv + JWT auth
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS + React Query
- Database: SQLite (local testing) → DynamoDB (AWS deployment)
- Storage: Local uploads → S3
- AI: AWS Bedrock (Claude vision) for recipe extraction
- Step-by-step setup, all code included, ready for Claude Code

### Open Threads
- Recipe book app ready for implementation by Claude Code
- Documents created in marvin/content/ for future reference
- TWC Week Feb 1-7: Still 3 of 4 activities (need 1 more by Saturday)
- 8 active job applications awaiting responses

### Next Actions
- Share implementation guide with Claude Code to build the app
- Test recipe extraction feature locally before AWS deployment
- Complete 1 more TWC activity by Saturday Feb 7

## Session: 15:40

### Topics
- MARVIN session briefing (corrected day: Tuesday, not Monday)
- Gmail OAuth authorization successful
- Gmail check for job application responses (no new responses)
- VetsEZ application acknowledgment received Feb 2
- Recipe Book App specification consolidation

### Decisions
- Consolidated 4 recipe book files into 1 master spec
- Recipe book approach: Serverless-first (AWS SAM, Lambda, DynamoDB)
- Target: Personal use (5 users), ~$0.60/month
- Python 3.14, AWS Bedrock AI extraction as core feature
- Master spec: 982 lines with complete code files for Claude Code

### Files Created/Modified
- Created: `content/recipe-app/Recipe-Book-Master-Spec.md` (982 lines)
- Contains: Complete SAM template, pyproject.toml, all route files, DynamoDB operations, Bedrock integration
- Old files kept for reference (not deleted)

### Recipe Book Master Spec Contents
- Complete SAM template with DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway, Lambda
- Full pyproject.toml with all dependencies
- Complete code files: auth, recipes, images, extract routes
- DynamoDB service with CRUD operations
- S3 service with presigned URLs
- Bedrock service with AI extraction
- JWT authentication system

### Open Threads
- Recipe book master spec ready for Claude Code to implement
- Google Workspace OAuth now working (authorized successfully)
- TWC Week Feb 1-7: Still 3 of 4 activities (need 1 more by Saturday)
- 8 active job applications (VetsEZ acknowledgment received)

### Next Actions
- Share Recipe-Book-Master-Spec.md with Claude Code for implementation
- Complete 1 more TWC activity by Saturday Feb 7
- Continue monitoring job application responses via Gmail

## Session: 13:04

### Topics
- Google Workspace MCP OAuth token expiration issue
- Permanent solution for Gmail integration
- Created .env file in marvin workspace for secure credential storage
- Configured Google Workspace MCP in Claude Desktop settings
- OAuth setup troubleshooting (authorization flow blocked by Google)

### Decisions
- Stored Google OAuth credentials in `~/marvin/.env` for persistence
- Ran Google Workspace setup script to add MCP to `~/.claude.json`

### Files Created/Modified
- Created: `marvin/.env` (Google OAuth credentials)
- Modified: `~/.claude.json` (added google-workspace MCP configuration)

### Open Threads
- Google OAuth authorization blocked - need to troubleshoot Google Cloud Console settings
- Possible issues: redirect URI configuration, test users, app verification status
- Gmail job response checking blocked until OAuth authorization completes

### Next Actions
- Troubleshoot Google OAuth blocking issue (redirect URI, test users, or app verification)
- Complete OAuth authorization to enable Gmail integration
- Resume automatic Gmail checking for job application responses
