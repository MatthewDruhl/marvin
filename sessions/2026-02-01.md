- Completed todos: Code Mentorship Style and Python PCAP Instructor placeholders added to global config

---

## Session: 11:35

### Topics
- Global CLAUDE.md configuration setup
- Multi-file CLAUDE.md hierarchy (global vs project-specific)

- Streamlined `~/marvin/CLAUDE.md` to reference global config (removed duplication)
- Removed VS Code multi-root workspace (concerns about MARVIN state file conflicts)
- Created separate CLAUDE.md files for each D&D sub-project:
  - Root: High-level overview + shared architecture
  - dnd-campaign-mcp: MCP-specific features and commands
  - dnd-character-sheet: Web app architecture and Phase 3 status
  - dnd-combat-engine: TDD approach and test commands
- Moved development guidelines to global config (applies to all projects)
- Marked todos as completed in state/todos.md

### Files Created/Modified
- Created: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global config)
- Updated: `~/marvin/CLAUDE.md` (removed duplication, added reference to global)
- Updated: `~/Code/AI/DnDProject/CLAUDE.md` (root overview)
- Created: `~/Code/AI/DnDProject/dnd-campaign-mcp/CLAUDE.md`
- Created: `~/Code/AI/DnDProject/dnd-character-sheet/CLAUDE.md`
- Updated: `~/Code/AI/DnDProject/dnd-combat-engine/CLAUDE.md`
- Updated: `~/marvin/state/todos.md` (marked 2 tasks completed)

### Open Threads
- TWC new week started (Feb 1-7): Need to create `work-search-week-2026-02-01.csv`
- D&D Character Sheet Phase 3: routes/ and characters.py still pending
- Fill in Code Mentorship Style and Python PCAP Instructor sections in global CLAUDE.md

### Next Actions
- Create new TWC weekly CSV file for Feb 1-7
- Continue D&D Phase 3: Build characters.py with CRUD endpoints
- Fill in placeholder sections in global CLAUDE.md (Code Mentorship Style, Python PCAP Instructor)
- Continue job search activities (4 required per week)

## Session: 12:18

### Topics
- Gemini CLI installation and testing
- MCP integration comparison (Gemini vs Claude Code)
- Gmail access performance testing
- Token usage analysis
- Tool removal (Gemini CLI)
- MCP configuration verification

### Decisions
- Installed Gemini CLI v0.26.0 with OAuth authentication
- Tested Gmail access: Gemini failed (no MCP), Claude Code succeeded with Google Workspace MCP
- Performance comparison: Claude Code + MCP more efficient for Gmail tasks
- Removed Gemini CLI completely (no use case that justifies it vs Claude Code)
- Confirmed Playwright MCP not actually installed (was assumed but not configured)

### Key Findings
- **Token usage:** Claude Code used ~6,900 tokens for successful Gmail query vs ~2,500 for both tests
- **Gmail access:** Claude Code: 100+ unread messages found. Gemini: No access without MCP setup
- **Conclusion:** Claude Code with existing MCP integrations is more efficient than adding duplicate tools
- **Chrome Control:** Only browser automation tool actually installed (not Playwright)

### Files Created/Modified
- Created: `~/.gemini/settings.json` (OAuth config)
- Removed: Gemini CLI package and config directory
- No changes to Claude MCP configuration

### Open Threads
- TWC new week started (Feb 1-7): Still need to create `work-search-week-2026-02-01.csv`
- D&D Character Sheet Phase 3: routes/ and main.py still pending
- Fill in Code Mentorship Style and Python PCAP Instructor sections in global CLAUDE.md

### Next Actions
- Create new TWC weekly CSV file for Feb 1-7
- Continue D&D Phase 3: Build routes/ with API endpoints
- Fill in placeholder sections in global CLAUDE.md
- Continue job search activities (4 required per week)

---

## Update: 15:36
- Added "Verify Capabilities Before Suggesting" section to global CLAUDE.md (check tools exist before recommending)
- Installed MCPs: Context7 (documentation), Docker (container management)
- Removed playwritgt MCP (failed connection)
- Background agent designed AWS recipe book architecture (serverless, $0-5/month)
- Job application response: Second Nature acknowledgment received

---

## Session: 15:39

### Topics
- MARVIN optimization and utilization discussion
- Multithreading capabilities exploration (MCP for state management)
- Parallel work vs sequential work patterns
- Proactive monitoring and anticipatory preparation ideas
- Task tool delegation strategies
- Job application tracking (Second Nature Home Wellness)

### Decisions
- Current MARVIN utilization: ~60-70% (working well but underutilizing parallel work)
- Don't build MCP for state management yet - wait for actual concurrent session pain points
- Identified improvement areas: parallel research, proactive monitoring, anticipatory prep, delegated research
- Markdown files are a feature (human-readable, git-trackable) not a limitation
- File locking would solve 80% of concurrency issues if needed

### Key Insights
- Task tool more powerful than currently using it
- Could parallelize research tasks (spawn multiple agents at once)
- Could run background monitoring throughout sessions
- Could prepare materials before being asked (anticipatory)
- Sequential when could be parallel is the main gap

### Files Created/Modified
- Created: `content/jobs/TWC/work-search-week-2026-02-01.csv` (new week started)
- Updated: `content/jobs/applications.md` (added Second Nature Home Wellness)
- Updated: `content/jobs/TWC/job-application-tracker.csv` (added Second Nature entry)

### Job Application Added
- **Second Nature Home Wellness** - Staff Platform Engineer
- Applied: 2026-02-01 via flexjobs.com
- Location: Remote, USA
- Salary: $150K-$200K + Equity

### Open Threads
- TWC Week Feb 1-7: 1 of 4 activities complete (6 days remaining)
- D&D Character Sheet Phase 3: routes/ and main.py still pending
- Optimization opportunities: parallel research, proactive monitoring, anticipatory prep
